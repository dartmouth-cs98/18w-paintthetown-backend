# Authentication
I created the last part of the back end of this blog web app. Now people need to sign up or log in before being able to see the posts,
and the browser remembers the users. For the extra credit part, I created an extra layer of security and privacy by disabling editing,
deleting, and updating for posts that weren't created by that user. The posts that one are blocked appear with italicized title and inc
case the user attempts to bypass it, it triggers a message to nottify the user he or she isn't authorized to make such requests.
